<h1>About PauseAI</h1>
<p>
	We are citizens from across the world who share a common concern—that artificial intelligence developed without consideration threatens our democracy, our jobs, our lives and our self determination. 
	We demand that the public—not just a few corporations, governments or individuals—decides how AI shapes our future.
