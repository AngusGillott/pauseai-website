## Narrative & core messages

- We need international regulations & collaboration. Why is China missing from this summit? Why is their AI safety institute not invited?
- A pause is technically feasible, for now. Supply chain regulation (e.g. through ASML) can help proliferation of AI training facilities, but we can't wait for too long, or it will be too late.
- We need an adult in the room. We need one country to step up and initialise treaty negotiations. And this is our job, we need to wake up our politicians, because noone else will.
