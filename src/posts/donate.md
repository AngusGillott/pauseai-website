title: Donate to PauseAI
description: With your financial support we can have a bigger impact.

We started PauseAI as a group of volunteers.
Since February 2024, PauseAI is a [registered non-profit foundation](/legal).
We still do not have sufficient funds to hire people to work full-time on PauseAI, so we effectively run on volunteer work.

## Costs

- **Legal & financial**: setting up the foundation (notary costs), bookkeeping.
- **Events**: renting a location, catering, travel costs.
- **People**: hiring people to work on PauseAI.

## How to donate to PauseAI

- Through our [merchandise store](https://pauseai-shop.fourthwall.com/).
