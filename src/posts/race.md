title: The race to AGI
description: AI companies are locked in a race to the bottom - where safety is the first thing to go.

> "One of the things we should be careful of when it comes to AI, is avoid 'Race Conditions', where people working on it across companies etc. so get caught up in who's first, that we lose potential pitfalls and downsides to it. [..] Does that keep me up at night? Absolutely."

We want the benefits from AI, but also make sure that it's safe and doesn't end in [disaster](/xrisk).
Individually, AI companies and countries also want to balance safety with progress.
This requires all of them to slow down and prioritize safety.
AI companies know this, and some of them have taken steps to prevent an AI race in the past.

But the incentives of racing are too strong.
Having the best AI model is a tremendous competitive advantage - it gets you more customers, more data, more investments.


OpenAI was created explicitly to "create a counterweight to Google and Deepmind", a non-profit dedicated to safety.


AI companies and countries are stuck in a [race to the bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom).
We know this concept from

## Companies

Now, it's a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft racing to achieve AGI.

## Nations

It's not just companies racing towards AGI - it's also nations.
They, too, have competitive advantages to gain from having the best AI.
There is a lot of money to be made from having a successful AI company in your country.
France and Germany [lobbied against the EU's AI regulation](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/ai-act-french-government-accused-of-being-influenced-by-lobbyist-with-conflict-of-interests/) because they were concerned that the safety requirements would slow down their AI companies.
But it's not just economic reasons - it's also military.
Countries are increasingly becoming aware that having powerful AI is a strategic asset.
The US (DARPA) is now collaborating with OpenAI.

## The solution: coordination
